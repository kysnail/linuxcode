# awk tutorial

## Why awk?
The Awk text-processing programming language is a useful tool for manipulating text.

    awk 语言可以用下面的五句进行概括：

 * Awk recognizes the concepts of "file", "record", and "field".
 * A file consists of records, which by default are the lines of the line. One line becomes one record.
 * Awk operates on one record at a time.
 * A record consists of fileds, which by default are seperated by any number of spaces or tabs.
 * Field number 1 is accessed with $1, filed 2 with $2, and so forth. $0 refers to the whole record.
