# awk, mawk, nawk, gawk... WHAT?

## awk
the most common and will be found on most Unix-like systems, oldest version and inferior to newer ones.

## mawk
fast AWK implementation which it's code base is based on a byte-code interpreter.

## nawk
while the AWK language was being developed the authors released a new version (hence the n - new awk) to avoid confusion. Think of it like the Python 3.0 of AWK.

## gawk
abbreviated from GNU awk. The only version in which the developers attempted to add i18n support. Allowed users to write their own C shared libraries to extend it with their own "plugin-ins". This version is the standard implementation for Linux, original AWK was written for Unix v7.

There are other versions like jawk(java implementation), bwk (Brian W.Kernighan's implementation) and so on.
