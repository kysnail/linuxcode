## Features

### Image capture
Shutter is primarily an image-capture tool. Shutter allows you to capture nearly anything on your screen without losing control over your screenshots, utilizing a tabbed interface. It provides diverse image-capturing functionality to capture common targets, including:

 * an arbitrary region of the screen
 * a desktop - including support for multi-monitor settings
 * an arbitrary window
 * a menu or tooltip
 * a website - using gnome-web-photo to capture an image without opening a browser window.
