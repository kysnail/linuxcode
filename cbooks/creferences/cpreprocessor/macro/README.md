# This folder contains macro expansions
The *C preprocessor* or *cpp* is the macro preprocessor for the C and C++ computer programming languages. The preprocessor provides the ability for the inclusion of header files, macro expansions, conditional compilation, and line control.

In man C implementations, it is a separate program invoked by the compiler as the first part of translation.

The language of preprocessor directives is agnostic to the grammar of C, so the C preprocessor can also be used independently to process other kinds of text files.
