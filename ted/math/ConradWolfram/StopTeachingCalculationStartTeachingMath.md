## Stop teaching calculation - Start teaching math
也不是我吹牛，关于数学的这种错误方式我在高中的时候就有感觉了。我始终觉得对于绝大部分的学生而言，你对数学的理解，吸收，远比机械的解题更有用。

大学时接触到的第一个计算工具就是  Matlab ，当时我就买了光盘，在租来的电脑上倒腾。高数中那些极端抽象的感念，完全可以在 Matlab 上以更直观的方式表达，更容易理解。

可绝大部分的老师仍然按部就班的使用老方法，机械的解题着，消耗着我们这些数学业余爱好者最后的兴趣。

### Use Computers

	Math is very popular ...
	... just not in education

### Why teach math?

	So let's zoom out a bit and ask,
	我们退一步再来看看，

	Well, I think there are about three reasons:
        #1.
	---
	technical jobs - so critical to the development of our economies, what I call everyday living.
        #2.
	--- 
	To function in the world today, you've got to be pretty quantitative, much more so than a few years ago. 
	Figure out your mortgages, being skeptical of government statistics, those
	kinds of things.
	#3.
	---
	And thirdly, what I would call something like logical mind training, logical thinking.
	we've put so much in society into being able to process and think 
	logically; it's part of human society. It's very important to learn
	that. What do we mean when we say we're doing math.

### What is math?
What is it that we want to ask? What is it we're trying to find out here?

#### Use computers for ...

 1. Posing the right questions
 2. Real world -> math formulation
 3. `Computation`
 4. Math formulation -> real world, verification

#### Use students for ...

 1. `Posing the right questions`
 2. `Real world -> math formulation`
 3. Computation
 4. Math formulation -> real world, verification

### math != calculating && math >> calculating
Math is not equal to calculating. Math is a much broder subject than calculating.

### Calculating: the machinery of math

### Today: 106 lifetimes learning hand-calculating

### Ancient Greek?

### Get the basics first

So what are the issues people bring up with this?

	So there's another thing that comes up with basics. People confuse,
	in my view, the order of the invention of the tools with the order 
	in which they should use them for teacing.

	It doesn't necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject
	by using paper instead of a computer to teach mathematics. 

	If you were born after computers and paper, it doesn't really matter 
	which order you're taught with them in, you just want to have the best
	tool.


### Computers dumb math down
So another one that comes up is "computers dumb math down."

	That somehow, if you use a computer, it's all mindless button pusing. 
	So the problem we've really got in math education is not that computers
	might dumb it down, but that we have dumbed-down problems right now.

### Hand calculating procedures teaching understanding

### More Practical and More Conceptual

	Questions like, what's the best life insurance policy to get? --

### Computer-based math: critical reform
We have to do in computer-based math, where high-level math is integral to what 
everyone does.

	So I believe critical reform, we have to do in computer-based math.
	We have to make sure that we can move our economies forward, and also
	our societies, based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics.
	This isn't some optional extra. And the country that does this first
	will, in my view, leapfrog others in achieving a new economy even, an
	improved economy, an improved outlook.

	In fact, I even talk about us moving from what we often call now the 
	knowledge economy to what we might call a computational knowledge economy,
	where high-level math is integral to what everyone does to what we might
	call a computational knowledge economy, in the way that knowledge currently
	is. We can engage so many more students with this, and they can have a
	better time doing it.

	And let's understand, this is not an incremental sort of change. We're 
	trying to cross the chasm here between school math and the real world
	math. And you know if you walk across a chasm, you end up making it 
	worse than if you didn't start at all -- bigger desaster.

	No, what I'm suggesting is that we should leap off, we should increase
	our velocity, so it's high, and we should leap off one side and go the 
	other -- of course, having calculated our differential equation very 
	carefully.

	So I want to see a completely renewed, changed math curriculum built 
	from the ground up, based on computers being being there, computers that
	are now ubiquitous almost. calculating machines are everywhere and will
	be completely everywhere in a small number of years. Now I'm not even 
	sure if we should brand the subject as math, but what I am sure is it's 
	the mainstream subject of the future.

	Let's go for it. And whil we're about it, let's hava a bit of fun, for 
	us, for the students and for TED here.

	Thanks
