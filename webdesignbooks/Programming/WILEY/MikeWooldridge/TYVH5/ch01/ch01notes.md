The HTML5 standars was originally developed by a separated organization called the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG). In 2007, the W3C adopted WHATWG's version as the starting point for its version of HTML5.

### HTML Versions
The most recent version of HTML is HTML5. As this book is been written, the HTML5 specification is still under development, but many popular web browsers already support much of the HTML5 functionality. Version 5 includes rules for using more than 100 different HTML tags, most of which are covered in this book. HTML5 improveson previous versions by including new tags for defining common types of page content, better support for audio and video, and drawing capability with the new <canvas> tag. HTML5 succeeds HTML 4.01, which was released in 1999.

### Browser Support
The development of a new HMLT5 standard and the appearance of new features in web browsers are both gradual processes.

### XHML
XHTML, or *Extensible Hypertext Markup Language*, is an alternative version of HTML that conforms to the stricter standars of XML, or *Extensible Markup Language*. XHTML is tag based and uses many of the same tags as HTML. However, in XHTML, all tags must be closed, tag name and attributes must be coded in lowercase, and attribute values for tags must be surrounded by quotes. For a time, the W3C group was developing a new XHTML 2.0 standard to take the place of HTML 4.01. In 2009, the group switched course to focus instead on HTML5. For more about XHTML, visit the W3C site at www.w3.org.
