##Inter-process communication - IPC
In computing, **Inter-process communication (IPC)** is a set of methods for the exchange of data among multiple threads in one or more processes. Processes may be running on one or more computers connected by a network. IPC methods are divided into methods for 

 * message passing
 * synchronization
 * shared memory
 * remote procedure calls (RPC)	

The method of IPC used may vary based on the bandwidth and latency of communication between the threads, and the type of data being communicated.
