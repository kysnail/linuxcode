## Unix domain socket
A **Unix domain socket** or **IPC socket** (inter-process communication socket) is a data communication endpoint for exchanging data between processes executing within the same host operating system. While similar in funcationality to **named pipes**, Unix domain sockets may be created as byte streams or as datagram sequences, while pipes are byte streams only. Processes using Unix domain sockets do not need to share a common ancestry. The API for Unix domain sockets is similar to that of an Internet socket, but does not use an underlying network protocol for communication. The Unix domain socket facility is a standard commont of POSIX operating systems.
