## FILO vs LILO
They are both bootloader.

### FILO
**FILO** is a bootloader which loads boot images from a local filesystem, without help from legacy BIOS services. Expected usage is to flash it into the BIOS ROM together with coreboot.

### LILO
**LILO** (LInux LOader) is a boot loader for linux.

LILO does not depend on a specific file system, and can boot an operating system (e.g., Linux kernel images) from floppy disks and hard disks.
