## Single-board computer
A **Single-board computer (SBC)** is a completer computer built on a single circuit board, with microprocessor(s), memory, input/output (I/O) and other features required of a functional computer. Unlike a typical personal computer, an SBC may not include slots into which accessory card ("daughterboards" may be plugged. An SBC may be based on almost any available microprocessor, and may be built up from discrete logic or programmable logic. Simple designs, such as built by computer hobbists, often use static RAM and low-cost eight or 16 bit processors.
